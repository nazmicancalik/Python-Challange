Solution:
	
Convert the text to a meaningful text via shifting the characters by 2.
Everybody thinks TWICE before solving this.
After that we got our lead, a text saying that we have to apply it to the link.
After applying cipher to the 'map.html' we get ocr.jvon.

If you go to that link we get a misleading tip. Not correct.
Apply cipher only to the 'map' which gives 'ocr'.
Then go to link + ocr.html

Next lead is here.
