Get a number 'next nothing.'
Paste it in the url. Gives another number.
Go to another next nothing. You are getting tired.
Use urllib to get the correct link after requesting 400 times.
Use the script to continue, when there is a misleading, code will stop eventually and you will see where you should go.
